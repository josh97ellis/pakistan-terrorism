### Introduction
This the final semester project for ECON 8310 - Business Forecasting  

The data come from a paper that my professor is working on in his own reserach. The paper relates to the difficulty of figuring out how active terrorist organizations are. In this data set, around half of the TWELVE THOUSAND terrorist attacks in Pakistan during the ten year window are unclaimed. That means we don't know who did it. That means we can't make any useful policies to keep it from happening again. Think about that for a minute! ðŸ¤¯

### The Goal
The best prediction that you can of which terrorist organization committed each of the unclaimed attacks in the data set
